Who
Hey, I’m Myles


What
Software Engineer, Photographer, Distance Runner, Furniture Enthusiast, Gospel Listener, Atlanta Hawks Fan, Amateur Botanist, Dog Father, Former Lego Kid


Why
I learned very young how strong the Lego kid to engineer adult pipeline was, so I think a lot of my family and childhood friends could’ve seen this coming. But the urge to build bled into every area of my life. I love telling people that I’m a third generation engineer, but I actually wanted to be an architect first because I was worried engineering would be boring. But having some patience, a willingness to fail, an eye for good work, and the spirit of competition served me through my realization that everything is engineering in some form. And now I’m not just building software - but also stories, health of mind and body, and a blueprint for the next Lego kid to follow.


As I grew up, documentation became more and more important to me and my footprint on the world. I’ve been blessed to build prosthetic arms, run a marathon, travel all over the world, photograph a documentary, and now I’m restoring a 1990 Cadillac Eldorado - so this portfolio is meant to be a way to share some of my favorite milestones with others. 


Also in 8th grade I was voted ‘Most Likely to Succeed’ by my class and I just can’t let my middle school peers down.


Where
Born in South Atlanta, but I’ve really been all over.


I went to college in Middle Georgia -> spent time studying in South Korea and the Dominican Republic -> Spent my first internship in Topeka, Kansas -> Moved to Huntsville, Alabama for my first job out of college -> relocated to Woodland Hills, just outside of LA -> came back to Atlanta -> and now I’m back in LA.


Couldn’t tell you where to next, but my coast is currently West and my hospitality is always Southern.
